PySpark is a great tool for handling large datasets and distributed data processing. Ensure you have PySpark installed:




PySpark Method:

1. Create Spark Session: Initialize a Spark session.
2. Read Parquet Files: Use spark.read.parquet to read all Parquet files in the specified directory into a Spark DataFrame.
3. Convert to Pandas: Optionally, convert the Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame using toPandas

Handling Large Datasets
If you are dealing with large datasets, the PySpark method is generally more efficient as it leverages Sparkâ€™s distributed computing capabilities. Pandas can be used for smaller datasets that fit into memory.

Additional Considerations
1. Partitioned Data: If your Parquet files are partitioned, both Pandas and PySpark can handle partitioned directories seamlessly.
2. Performance: For large-scale data processing, always prefer PySpark to Pandas due to its ability to handle distributed data processing efficiently.
