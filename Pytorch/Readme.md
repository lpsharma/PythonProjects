Key Components
data/: Contains datasets or scripts to download datasets. Keeping data separate from code is a good practice.
models/: Contains PyTorch neural network models. You might have multiple models for different tasks.
utils/: Utility scripts for various tasks like data preprocessing, model saving/loading, and other helper functions.
weights/: Stores trained model weights. This allows you to keep track of different versions of trained models.
results/: Used for storing output from model predictions, including visualizations, to analyze the model's performance.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks are invaluable for experimentation and analysis. They allow for interactive development and testing.
tests/: Contains test cases for your project. It's important to test your code to ensure reliability.
requirements.txt: Lists all the project dependencies. This file is used to set up an identical environment on different machines or deployment environments.
config.py: Central place for all configuration settings. Keeping configurations in one place makes managing and changing settings easier.
train.py: The main script for training your models. This includes loading data, model instantiation, training, and saving model weights.
infer.py: Script for making predictions with a trained model. It should handle loading the model, processing input data, and running the model to make predictions.
