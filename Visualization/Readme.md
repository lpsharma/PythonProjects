Explanation:

    Univariate Analysis:

        The histogram and KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plot show the distribution of sepal lengths in the Iris dataset.

    Bivariate Analysis:

        The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between sepal length and sepal width. It helps in understanding how these two variables are related.

    Multivariate Analysis:

        The pairplot shows pairwise relationships between all features in the dataset. The hue parameter adds color to the points based on species, allowing us to see how different species are distributed in the feature space
